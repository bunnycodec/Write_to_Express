							<p>Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion with signs and symbols.
							In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language, but a tool developed by human society. 
							Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar, and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. 
							The result of writing is called text, and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. 
							Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems.<br><br>
							Writing is critical to becoming a good reader. Writing is an essential job skill. Writing is the primary basis upon which one’s work, learning, and intellect will 
							be judged—in college, in the work place and in the community. Writing equips us with communication and thinking skills. Writing expresses who we are as people. 
							Writing makes our thinking and learning visible and permanent. Writing fosters our ability to explain and refine our ideas to others and ourselves. Writing preserves our ideas and memories. 
							Writing allows us to understand our lives. Writing allows us to entertain others.</p>
